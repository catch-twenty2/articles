20th March was the first day of Spring so from now on every day we will have more light outside. But there is also something called Blue Light, which is not so great. It might be helpful for you to know how to work, not only more effectively, but also healthy. Feel free to share your thoughts in comments below.

We live in times, when we are constantly bombarded by screens. In work, at home, even in subway. Beside that, smartphones became our mobile centers for entertainment and remote offices. It’s not unusual to do daily business using only the smartphone. All those commodities unfortunately have a price and. CVS [(Computer vision syndrome)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision_syndrome) is more and more common. Let’s see how we can make the life easier for our eyes. 

For millennials humans had light coming from either sun or candle. In comparison to that, light bulb - invented just almost 150 years ago - is still something new to our species. Among other inventions like railroad or internet, it transformed the way we live. Light became ubiquitous. Instead of yellowish color of candles or sun, we are exposed to the unnatural cold white. Without going too much into physics, we know that light temperature is measured in Kelvins: candle has 1850K, traditional light bulbs 2400K, and daylight coming from the sun 6500K. Read more about [Color temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_temperature).

When the sun goes down, our brain starts producing melatonin, which is hormon of sleep. However the process is suppressed by staying late at night and being exposed to light coming from such sources as TV or smartphone. Our sleep - which is important factor in our life, not only for growth and learning - in result gets worse. And without good quality sleep we get tired more easily. Some folks are even becoming more sensitive than others to light: [“As a medical symptom, photophobia is not a morbid fear or phobia, but an experience of discomfort or pain to the eyes due to light exposure or by presence of actual physical sensitivity of the eyes”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photophobia).

Few years ago I was placed in office with fluorescent bulbs, which were causing me headaches. As you know, in comparison to constant light in traditional or even LED bulb, those bulbs have gas inside the tube and produce light by flickering with a frequency not visible to human eye. And not visible doesn’t mean not existing. The flickering is still perceived by the brain. Find more research about it from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescent_lamps_and_health).

Whenever possible I turned the lights off and used the lamp on my desk only. But I was not alone in the room and my boss told me to do some research to find compromise. For him, the best lightning was the direct one allowing him to see everything clearly - it helped him to stay energetic. In my case, I preferred to use similar techniques as in cinematography. To use pointed lamps and to direct them only on my areas of focus. No need to be distracted by non-essential tidbits. Light reflected from the wall or ceiling instead of direct one is softer and far better. More atmospheric, romantic, and yes, healthy.

Full disclaimer - I have no profit from recommending products in this article. Feel free to try and choose what serves you best! When in doubt, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

In the following article I will try to introduce you to the best practices of taking care of your eyes. Feel free to choose the ones, which are best suitable for you. For simplicity the content was broken into three main sections: Environment, Computer, Body.

# ENVIRONMENT
Starting from the environment, I am sure we’ve all seen examples of ergonomic office. The problem is, we never put it into practice. Having a seat in open space for 50+ people can intimidate and minimize our influence, but there are still things we could do. First, let’s speak about the windows. The general rule of thumb is not to sit front or back to the windows, even if it’s facing North. The light from outside would either blind us or reflect on the monitor, so it will be harder to read. If we can’t sit on a side due to office setup, we should use curtains or blinds to adapt. The room with no windows seems like a perfect solution, and I used to work in such at TV station. It’s good when you have to do color sensitive work like editing or design, because it’s not dependable on constant flow of clouds, however it forces you to use artificial light all the time. Ultimately the natural source of light is the best.

It’s a good idea to have [a lamp](https://www.amazon.de/tomons-Schreibtischlampe-Augenfreundliche-Arbeitsleuchte-Nachttischlampe/dp/B016XJG65Y) on your desk. It should be directed on the surface of desk only, so in effect our keyboard, phone and whichever papers we will have there will be clearly visible. . Anything beside that should have less amount of light. No lamp should be pointed at monitor, which itself is a source of light. Other sources of light we’ll use could be 50% less powerful, and at best shouldn’t be pointed directly at us. Much better to bounce them from the walls (which usually are white) or ceiling. Stand alone lamps with tulip cover or paper should do fine.

If we happened to have only the top-mounted fluorescent lamps, there is still hope. We can buy colored ones or at least cover them with plastic (and fireproof) filters for the tube and lamp as well. Mandarin and amber would make it warm, for some people it might be too warm, however. It’s the first impression, after some time they could be used to that. When it comes to bulbs itself, we have lots of choice. The traditional ones using wolfram were removed from EU in favor of… fluorescent ones (due to environmental worries). The normally unnoticeable 100–120 Hz flicker from fluorescent tubes powered by electromagnetic ballasts are associated with headaches and eyestrain. The ability of fluorescent lamps to suppress melatonin after nocturnal light exposure is strongly dependent on the color temperature of the lamp, so warm white lamps are recommended for use at nighttime in order [to prevent melatonin suppression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosensitivity_in_humans). 

Well, now we can also use LED, which are not that perfect, but still better. On the package of bulb there is usually the information about temperature. Warm white is a good indication, 2200K. There are also the amber ones reminding us of Edison times, which by the way often are found in climatic cafeterias and bars as part of decoration. What is more, some expensive bulbs allow to diminish the light, either directly or by remote control. There are also sets of [Philips Hue bulbs](https://www.amazon.de/6er-Pack-Gl%C3%BChbirne-Vintage-bernsteinfarben-dimmbar/dp/B079944MYX) which could be pre-programmed along with f.lux software. We’ll speak about computers in a moment.

Sometimes during the work you might feel itchiness or fatigue in one eye only. I’d suggest using only one eye, the other can sleep. The trick is often used by snipers (Robert Duvall in “Jack Reacher”), after being ‘asleep’, the covered eye would see better in darkness. You might have an [eyepatch](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B01FZBRA0G) around, which doesn’t force you to squint.

If you happened to stay late at night just to entertain yourself with watching sport, movies or YouTube, there is much better choice than screen of your smartphone, laptop or TV. After all, you don’t want to look at the source of light in the night, so projector is the perfect choice for having a good sleep after. There are lot of cheap products on the market. The nights are dark anyway, so you don’t need to worry about getting the best contrast ratio. But be careful, not all of the projectors are designed for work. So for writing or showing presentations you should definitely get the more advanced one. Some of the projectors are equipped with native loud speaker and allows the wi-fi streaming from smartphones, some even have their own software allowing to play from SD card or USB. That means you are not limited by cables. I am using [this one](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B079FHCVC5).


# BODY
Constant staring at the screen leads to eye fatigue and dry eyes. There are lots of different eye drops available at the pharmacies to reduce the pain. Be warned though, not to keep them at your desk, but in cool dry place and not exposed to light (the best place would be the fridge). Some products have expiration in 6 months, while other are good for 6 weeks from opening. You should note on the etiquette the date of opening the bottle to be sure it’s still fresh. Disposable packages have some advantage, as they are not getting air from being open regularly. There are even some eye drops which you can spray on your eyelids. You can use eye drops multiple times per day, but it shouldn’t be your habit. Beware that using [eye-drops can be addictive](https://www.essilorusa.com/newsroom/can-you-be-addicted-to-eye-drops), though. In results, your organism will start to make your eyes even dryer, so use it only when needed. You should try to blink more often, consciously. 

If you sense lots of eye fatigue, don’t rub them! It can make the matter worse. It’s better to go to bathroom and splash cold water on closed eyelids what will give them some rest. By now I do it habitually after each time I wash my hands. Speaking of water, you should drink lots of it to avoid dehydration. Our body is mostly consisting of water, but we need more of it and in pure H2O form, not disguised as coffee or juices (organism needs more time to digest them, while pure water can be delivered directly to cells). Coffee has additionally a dehydrating side effect, thus the more coffee you drink the more water you should get to compensate the loss.

Let’s not forget about proper nutrition. The best food for our eyes are lutein and zeaxanthin. You could buy lutein in pharmacy, or even at local kiosk. Zeaxanthin is harder to get and more expensive, but has better effects. A clinical trial showed improvement in visual performance and decrease in light sensitivity after taking 10 mg lutein and 2 mg zeaxanthin per day for 12 months. Since your local pharmacy might need to order it from wholesaler you could check it at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B073WCFYCD).

Natural source of zeaxanthin are green vegetables. The richest of them is Kale (Grünkohl or Brassica oleracea), and you can use it for salads, sauces, cook with meat, or eat directly. The taste is not bad, similar to spinach (which is healthy, too). Carrot is also considered good food for the eyes, however by getting too much Vitamin A you might get into other troubles. Fish oils are not to be overlooked, whether as capsules of omega 3 capsules or direct intake. They’re also great for your heart and mental strength. The thing is, to make it work, you should take it regularly for at least one quarter, not sporadically.

Recently I started to use [nighttime gel](https://www.amazon.de/Artelac-4049649000213-Nightime-Gel-10g/dp/B0054O5NZO/) which I place into lower eyelids before going to sleep. It helps to hydrate the eyeballs and give them some rest. You can also get them during day, however your vision for some time will be blurred (not good, if you need to drive). When it comes to sleeping itself, the room should be well ventilated and not too hot (18 Celsius degrees is the optimal temperature for sleep). It shouldn’t be bright as well. So if you have a street lamp behind the window - this can lead to insomnia - use the curtains or blinds. What I found astonishingly helpful is sleeping mask. It worked on a long-distance trip in bus, it also worked at home. No more distractions from the cars passing behind the window, everything is beautifully black and your quality dreams are uninterrupted. There are some models with [pocket for ice-pack](https://www.dm.de/ebelin-schlafmaske-mit-gel-pad-p4010355525574.html). What a relief. Before going to sleep take the ice gel from the freezer and place it in the sleeping mask’s pocket. It won’t contact your eyes directly, only through the soft fabric, so it’s safe. By melting slightly the ice-gel will help you get rested eyes. 

Going back to location in office, take care of what you’re looking at. If the only thing in front of you is the monitor and wall, it means that accommodation system of your eyes will suffer. The minimal distance from screen should be 50 cm. Is it? The monitor shouldn’t be placed too low. Get some adjustable monitor stand like [this](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B00X4SCCFG/). Our eyebrows should be at the height of top side of the screen, not above and not below. Some of us are surrounded by two screens plus laptop which leaves no space in between. Not good, it prompts us more to shortsightedness. Being surrounded by walls and screens makes our accommodation lazy.

There is one great exercise called the rule 20-20-20, which helps our eye muscles be stronger. For every 20 minutes take a break for 20 seconds and look at something far away in distance of at least 20 metres. Simple. Sitting by the window helps a lot to refocus the mechanism in eyes. But you can also look to the corner of the office. In worst case you can fake it by looking at the mirror located at the other wall, which could artificially expand the distance. And most important, don’t forget to blink! Especially when you’re focusing intensely on some thought process, your eyes tends to freeze. Let them relax. Don’t touch them directly - you can release the tension by massaging the skull around your eye holes. Under the skin you will sense small cavity. Press firmly with your finger for few seconds. Massage will also improve the blood circulation in this area. Check out the [Shiatsu techniques for eyes](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/general-malware-page?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2estylecraze%2ecom%2Farticles%2Fbest-acupressure-points-for-better-eye-sight).

Wearing contact lenses can be especially problematic - even neutral glasses are better for work with computer. I know that your eye vision might be in perfect condition and you can still be sensitive to light. Especially when you had a laser operation, which biggest flaw is decreased vision at night and even more sensitivity to bright light. But even if your vision is totally fine, 20-20, I would still recommend to use simple glasses. The era of CRT monitors thankfully is over, nevertheless modern screens are also radiating. Better if the wave will hit not your eyeballs directly, but the plastic glasses with [Anti-Blue Light Filter](https://www.misterspex.de/brillen-ratgeber/blaufilter-brillen).

They are designed to pass all colors, but blue. As you might know, each color we perceive is build out of combination of three basic colors: Red, Green and Blue. Each monitor is using that scheme. Blue is however the coldest one and if you work at night, Blue will suppress the melatonin which is telling your organism, that it’s still not a time for sleep. Blue light turns safe molecules in the retina into cell killers. More info on Blue-light [here](http://www.bluelightexposed.com/#blue-light-and-macular-degeneration) and [here](https://www.allaboutvision.com/cvs/blue-light.htm).

Currently there are more and more applications, filters and glasses for night-time use. It’s proven that they improve the quality of sleep and reduce the eyestrain. You could buy a simple pair of glasses (with 0 value) with that filter, or a [clip-on lenses](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B01MS845C5/), if you wear glasses already. In that case it’s more comfortable to get secondary [put-on glasses](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B01HD67ILC). They look a bit outstanding (like a cheap parody of Elvis Presley), but that’s their biggest vice. On the positive side, they will help you use your regular glasses under (make sure they will fit the size) and block you from cold light coming from top and sideways. You will quickly notice huge improvement and perceive the world around you as pale and bleached. Totally weird experience! 

You might also try the [glasses with tinted lenses](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B008IBGCEG). Those with orange, yellow or amber tint are particularly good for our purpose of warming your vision. However their main usage is for night drive. Driving at night, especially during rain, makes you see even less. Blinding reflectors of cars coming in your direction with light reflected from the road is dangerous. By improving the contrast night drive glasses acts like noctovisors. That’s why so many snipers - and in computer world - gamers, are using them. They improve your seeing. Additional benefit is that they make the world much warmer. It’s as though you wear the glasses of optimist - everything and everybody looks nicer.

If the light from monitor is your less worry, because you still have those dreadful fluorescent lamps above you, don’t go for sunglasses. Although they can make you look cool, wearing sunglasses indoors can make symptoms worse over time as it will dark-adapt the retina which aggravates sensitivity to light. Instead buy yourself a basketball cup. As simple as that. It will greatly reduce the amount of light and flickering coming from above. It could give you also more relaxed, startup-like easy-going outlook! With so many varieties of them, you can get a cap with logo of your favorite football team, musician, startup company or… [Wayne’s World](https://www.amazon.de/Wayne-World-Waynes-bestickte-Baseball/dp/B00CI1QPEO/). Whatever suits your character. 

# COMPUTER
Most of the job today we do by switching our gaze between the monitor and keyboard. Rarely at something else. Sounds pretty mechanistic. Our bodies are moving less and less, we’re stiffing and becoming even more like machines… OK, it isn’t so bad, yet. We can always make the job easier for us by taking more breaks and walking more often: taking stairs, not elevator, leaving 1-2 stations earlier, you know the drill. Unfortunately organic monitors (OLED) came out too early and as a result they were not able to revolutionize the market (just like Blu-Ray or 3D movies). Luckily, LCD screens - which are standard in our computers - are still much friendlier for the eyes than CRT. Probably the most natural for us is E ink display screen like the one used in Kindle and [YotaPhones](https://www.amazon.de/Yota-YotaPhone-Octa-Core-Fingerprint-Smartphone-schwarz) (they even have a built-in LCD to help read in dark), but not in typical business machines. There are multiple ways by which we can reduce eye strain, though. 

Starting from the monitor itself, whenever possible try not to buy glossy screens. They reflect all the light, making exterior work impossible, and gives your face reflection on the screen like a mirror. All of that forces your eyes even more to make the details readable. Eliminating glare, i.e. matching the brightness of your screen to that of the environment is key to reducing eye strain. And going to 100% on brightness is actually what you try to avoid if you have sensitive eyes. When possible, get the monitors with matte screens (especially if you can get external one). The first thing you can do is to adjust brightness and contrast to fit the lightning in your room. Some screens and laptops have separate buttons, sometimes you need to go to OSD menu. Try to regulate it to have the best comfort. Too dark screen, on the other side, would force your stare too much. The point is to read the text without squinting.

Frequency doesn’t play a big role anymore. Technically we don’t see movement on the screen, even when watching movies. What we see is a series of static images. The constant refreshment is visible to human eye. But if we can get above 60Hz, we should do that. That means the image on the screen is refreshed 60 times per second (just like movies filmed in HD can get 60 frames per second). Monitors offering 100 or 120Hz would be even more natural. Check the setting of your GPU, if it allows to go for higher frequency.

To be sure that you are buying the best monitor, try to look for those with Anti Blue Light switch. As described earlier, blue light is the most important factor of our discomfort. For example [BenQ Eye-Care](https://www.amazon.de/BenQ-GW2760HS-Zoll-Monitor-Reaktionszeit/dp/B00BPL0558/ref=sr_1_4
) screen with Sens-eye system could reduce blue light by 30, 50 and even 75%. 

Here’s a note for color sensitive professions. If you need to do color grading or design for print, go ahead and calibrate your monitor for the best outcome. But if you don’t work on color-sensitive tasks 100% of your time, switch to the safe-mode. It will save your eyes in the long run and you can always turn it off when you need it. After all, temp files are not worth the effort as much as final version.

I would highly recommend [f.lux application](https://justgetflux.com/), which I’m devotedly using for the last decade. They have also a strong community behind the product for sharing knowledge, which helps it become even better.  After being installed the program does literary nothing, until the dusk. The feature changes the color temperature of the display towards the yellowish part of the color spectrum that reduces some of the blue light from the screen. In other words, f.lux decreases the temperature of the screen (dynamically or gradually), in order to maintain the balance between the screen and exteriors. You just need to give your location (city or latitude and longitude), so it will know at what time the sun is setting. As mentioned in previous paragraph, if it’s already evening and you need to do color-sensitive work, there is a pre-set to turn to default mode for an hour (or until sunrise, if you wish to watch a movie). Usually it’s should be enough for a quick fix. Lots of work with editing the films or designing posters don’t need a constant real color reproduction or contrast. It is more about proportions and relations between the objects. So turn off f.lux only for those cases.

Beside a standard night time mode, f.lux offers now more experiences like: Amber, Candle, Movie Mode or even Dark room (if we want to go to the extreme). We can also disable the app for fullscreen apps (like watching movies or games). The recent novelty is the synchronization with Philips Hue Lights - thus f.lux will control also the temperature of the lamps in our house via mobile app. But the so called IoT and Smart House have a price: they are not password protected and easy to hack into. As noted by Berlin Spy Museum, outsiders can use them to signal information such as secret passwords via light impulses (up to 100 metres), and the process is not detectable by human eye. Alternatives to f.lux for MacOS/iOS and Linux are respectively, [Redshift](http://jonls.dk/redshift/) and [Night Shift](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207513).

I have love-hate relation with MS Windows, but knowing it’s pros and cons I am OK with using this OS on daily basis (with small tweaks and adjustments, of course). One of the first setting that I change when starting working on new machine, is switching the color theme (I am sure that Mac OS and Linux have similar or better settings). Click the right button of your mouse on any empty space of desktop and choose Personalize. Then go to Color settings and select High Contrast (there are 4 various options in Windows 10). As a result the taskbar, start menu and the default background of each application will turn from white to black. As a result, Word/Excel white background will become black, and black text will become white. Scary! But if you remember the first computers, black was the standard for Amiga or DOS. In a way, it’s very ecological - helps you save the energy! Going for black them can definitely save a lot of your smartphone’s battery too (most of the energy goes to LCD screen alone).

The recent version of Windows 10 allows you to switch into Gray Scale! Who needs that, you might ask. In my recent job one guy was joking, that they gave me black&white monitor, because I’m still on probation. What a joker! I’ve realized that I can focus better on my work if I don’t get distracted by colors, used mostly for the purpose of branding, marketing, and selling. Try it! After all, if you’re using the same apps over and over again, you remember the location of each button, no need to have them in action-triggering red. For the psychological power of color, it’s psychology and symbolic, you can refer to [Color_psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_psychology) or [Patty Bellantoni’s book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Its-Purple-Someones-Gonna-Die/dp/0240806883).

Since I work with pure information only, I don’t need special decorations. LinkedIn is trying to steal my attention with auto-played videos and eye-catchy ads. Gray Scale makes their impact weaker. Also, as proven in photography, black&white pictures look more elegant and classic. You are no longer distracted by fancy clothes or surroundings. I am aware though, that in engineering job color-coding could be huge improvement for all syntaxes.

Going back to High Contrast, it co-operates well with many applications, but with some of them it doesn’t. They weren’t designed for that. For example, whenever I used Photoshop to edit the white/black levels, I couldn’t see the histogram and had to switch-off High Contrast mode for that operation. Some applications, however, might have their own Dark Mode. Software like AIMP or even YouTube platform have easy to find switch. Total Commander has its own customization setting, so you could freely select the color for whichever element visible within the window.

Now let’s switch to the powerful tool, which for most of us is the ultimate one. The web browser. These days there are so many web applications, that you could manage your files on the drive and edit Word documents without leaving the browser. In a way browser became an OS of its own, so natural that Google installed Chrome OS on laptops manufactured by them. So far Chrome has the most extensions, which makes it highly flexible tool. And as my friends noticed, I use dozens of extensions. So many that I need to divide them between multiple users designed for various purposes (home, work, sourcing, play, testing). That way it is much easier to manage RAM distribution and your own attention. Another big topic, let’s go back to main subject.

Since so many of our daily operations are done within browser and web pages have their own styles and themes, High Contrast setting cannot affect them. There are however bunch of themes and extensions for Chrome, which can be highly beneficial for your eyes. For each of the recommended ones, you can easily find some alternatives. Feel free to experiment. Usually when I start installing new environment, I change the theme and default page. So far my favorite theme is [Morpheon Dark](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/morpheon-dark/mafbdhjdkjnoafhfelkjpchpaepjknad), it makes everything black.

Empty black page makes sure, that whenever I open new empty tab, my eyes won’t be shock by sudden attack of paleness. It took me sometime to find that extension, because I didn’t know how to name it for search. What I am still missing is the solution to change the background of native settings within Chrome, which still has white background. Any hint? Luckily I don’t need to lurk there too often. You can start as well with [black page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/empty-new-tab-page-black/fllomkdgoahjlgcblpldnpjcilipjelp), which reduces the shock.

Another must-have extension is [Hacker Vision](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hacker-vision/fommidcneendjonelhhhkmoekeiced). No, it won’t help you to hack. But it will make bystanders think, that you can. That tool inverts all websites into opposite color. So white background will become black, black will become white. We don’t want it white, so on that particular website we will switch off the extension. It will create its own database of websites, so we don’t need to change it too often. The biggest disadvantage is, however, that on some pictures you will see its negative. Not such a pleasant experience, especially when it comes to people’s faces. On the other hand, faces could be also distracting, so it’s up to you. The first 6 months of using Hacker Vision are for trial, afterwards the software costs 3 USD per Year. What a bargain! I am paying subscription for one, but because it is linked to google account, I can’t use it for other users.There are however similar tools. [Dark Night Mode](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-night-mode/bhbekkddpbpbibiknkcjamlkhoghieie) with the face of Batman I found so far the best alternative.. There is as well [Dark Reader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-reader/eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh) with multiple settings for brightness, but I found it in many cases too complicated and not intuitive.

Additionally you can guard yourself with such tools as:
* - [Eye Protector](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eye-protector/fgadnbmmolnmbkbklpaojbogcopipopl), 
* - [Screen Shader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-shader-flux-for-ch/fmlboobidmkelggdainpknloccojpppi), 
* - [Blue Light Filter Guard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blue-light-filter-guard/kkkdnikbcmebldaglhjpdkanfnmpjhak).

They warm up the temperature even more than default mode by f.lux and in some cases you can regulate various factors. For Screen Shader you are even given a keyboard combination to quickly adjust shades, as easy as changing the volume. By using those extensions some of your favorite websites might look weird, or even bad. If you’re more after information than aesthetics, it could suit you fine. After all you can turn on and off extension any time you want (even in bulk, by adding Extensions into groups) with this [Manager](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-chrome-extension-m/balnpimdnhfiodmodckhkgneejophhhm).

`***`

I hope that some of aforementioned solutions would work fine for you. As a result you will be more rested, energized and hopefully… not spending gained time on using screens longer. A word of caution. You can use all of the methods at the same time. But as you can imagine, therein lies a paradox. The more you’ll be used to work with dark, the more fragile you will be when exposed to ‘normal’ conditions. As for me, what works best is: high-contrast and dark themes on PC, wearing anti-blue light glasses at work and sleeping mask at night. Good luck in your own journey toward healthier work, and let me know your comments below what works best for you.
