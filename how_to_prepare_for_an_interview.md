**We all know that it is easier to land a new job when you are already employed. Your value is much bigger in the eyes of a potential employer. Also your chance to get hired is higher when using the help of a headhunter, sourcer or a person who can refer you. But it doesn’t mean you should act like a diva and expect a special treatment. As a perfect candidate, not in the hurry to land a new job, you should actually offer solving problems for the new employer, rather than creating them. Here is how to make the winning impression and reduce the likelihood of potential disappointments.**

Job interview is one of the most stressful situations we face in life. But you can be prepared for it. Fortunately, recruiters will rather send you an e-mail inviting you to an interview, rather than demanding to speak to you about your achievements at any time.

It is not in your interest to agree to a spontaneous phone call. It might indicate your desperation and due to an uncomfortable setting (being in a bus, park or actually at work) you might be disorganized and feel uncomfortable. Noise, distraction or connection problems will prevent you from making a good first impression. Moreover, arranging a conversation for a later date will allow you to refresh your knowledge about the company and check the latest news.

To understand your objectives for each step of the recruitment process, review the below:

1. First interview -> obtaining more information (and getting the recruiter to like you),

2. Interview with the Hiring Manager or team -> demonstrating your expertise and skills, but also bonding with others (cultural fit),

3. A trial day / test / case study -> showing your practical skills (often done at your own time),

4. Call with an offer and receiving the contract -> negotiating the salary, start time, holidays, title of position.

## 1. Basic information
Knowledge about your interviewers will demonstrate your commitment and professionalism. You shouldn’t forget to ask relevant questions and sell your expertise well. In order to look confident during the conversation, prepare all the information you need to present ahead of time. This will allow you to jump straight to the answer, rather than trying to figure out stuff on the spot. Below I divided into four categories the most crucial information you need to gather.

### 1.1. Recruitment process and interlocutor
Try to recognize ahead of time:
+ what type of conversation to expect (over telephone, video, face-to-face; with one person, two, or maybe combined with a live test),
+ how long it will last,
+ in what language (if the role requires fluency in foreign language).

Ask who you will talk to: their name and role within the team and within the process. You can check their LinkedIn: the companies they worked for, studies or responsibilities. Thanks to that also your small-talk will go smoother. This will also help you to adjust your personal style of communicating to particular person:

+ If they mainly worked in the HR department, you can expect questions about your personality and motivation, rather than hard skills.
+ If it’s your potential supervisor, they will want to know how you work, asking for specific examples.

### 1.2. Position, company and industry
Now analyze the job advertisement carefully. Find a suitable example from your experience to illustrate how you fulfill each requirement. And if it deviates from your existing responsibilities, consider how you can compensate it with quick learning.

Browse the LinkedIn profiles of employees in this company to check what are their responsibilities and achievements (profile might be slightly out of date). There is a chance you will end up working with these persons, or maybe replace someone. By comparing descriptions of employees at the same position you will understand what is expected from you. Also if they didn’t mention the particular skill you have it can become your added value.

You also need to know what the company is doing, what kind of product or service it offers, in which locations, how many employees are there, how long it has been on the market. Knowing the industry in which the company operates, will help you to better understand their expectations in hiring. Recent news about their successes will be an advantage (acquisition of a competing company, going public, acquiring a new market). You can always boost their ego by mentioning you want to help them with those recent challenges they’re facing.

### 1.3. Information about yourself
Finally, you should know your resume like the back of your hand. No question should surprise you, whether it is about the period of employment, team size or achievements. Don’t get caught off guard when asked about hobbies, courses you took or some minor activity you mentioned. So prepare a short story about your recent jobs when it comes to scope of duties, achievements and even what you have learned from it.

### 1.4. Questions to the interviewer
This part of the interview is usually underestimated by candidates, who don’t realize how much it says about their motivation. Quality of your questions shows that you really thought about your career path, not that you are interested in any new job. Questions shouldn't be too general and referring to stuff you can find online - the more specific the better. You can get more insight into your future work and be sure you are taking the right step.

Ask them what type of employee will be successful in this company, what is the management style of your future supervisor, how efficiency is measured and what kind of challenges the team or the whole company faces now. This will also help you to prepare for self-presentation in the further stages. Therefore, if they will say that they need specialists able to analyze the data, tell them about the successes you achieved in this field. Show them how you will provide solutions, rather than creating problems.

Skip questions about salary, overtime, vacations or social benefits – it will reassure the recruiter that your main motivation is money. You will get the answers anyway before signing the contract. It is the recruiter's interest to ask you about money at some point. Otherwise if they can’t afford you, they risk spending too much time for nothing. In case you want to be sure you won’t lose your time, you can state your minimum salary upfront in your reply - such frank statement will be welcomed well.

## 2. Arranging a remote call
Making a phone call seems quite simple. You just need a quiet place where no one will bother you for at least half an hour. But if you work in the office, then finding time in your schedule can be tricky. Any conversation that interferes with your normal working day may arouse suspicions. Especially if the talk will take longer than lunch break, which is often the case with final interviews, where you meet several people.

### 2.1. Excuse
Prepare a solid alibi in advance. An excuse of being late due to train delay, child's illness, visiting a doctor, janitors repair or meeting a client can be easily verified later and you might lose face. Sometimes the simplest solution - especially when you have appointments with several interviewers - is to take a day off. Mondays and Fridays, will be much better than the middle of the week for obvious reasons. Also, it is much easier to take an interview if you work from home, but what if you have to travel to another city or country? In that case you might need to plan ahead. Fortunately these days due to Covid-19 many companies turned to use video calls, which is saving time, money and effort.

### 2.2. Time and place
Mornings before your work starts are best. You will have fresh energy and after the conversation you can go to your work. But not many companies are offering early bird calls. Lunchtime would work only for the initial call, as probably you won’t ride to the district too far from your place anyway. Again, video calls are quite liberating. A conversation after work is harder as you need to finish your work on time, and might have less energy. Also being late or cancelling appointments due to overtime at work leaves a bad impression.

### 2.3. Video calls
Video calls require good data transfer (and sufficient credits, if you use a prepaid card). If you don’t take the call from home, try to find a place with stable Wi-Fi. Some stores, galleries or train stations offer free access, but logging into the network and its bandwidth can be an unnecessary stress factor. Buying an extra data package from your provider makes more sense. You can always tether the connection to the laptop.

Making a video call from your smartphone can also be a convenient option. You just need to sit at the right distance from the camera and have a headset for better audio quality on both sides. Set the phone on something stable, don’t hold it in hand. Otherwise the lack of stability in the background (shaky picture) will irritate the other person. Lastly, make sure that there are no distractions in your background.

## 3. Preparation for the onsite interview
Recently most of the job interviews are conducted remotely, but some companies might invite you to their office for the final round, and maybe for additional lunch to meet coworkers in an informal way. Visiting offices will give you more insights about company culture and what kind of people are working there. The Internet can’t offer that.

After first discussions you’ve collected already more information about the role, the team and what kind of problems they are working on. Remember that between two stages of your interviews your interviewers talked to other candidates, so now they better understand what the market offers. This is why you should still do research and dive deeper in details. Present yourself as the most competent candidate. Don’t forget to ask them more detailed questions – after all you want to be sure this will be the best place for you to grow. The quality of your questions can say much more about your understanding of the job than all your answers.

### 3.1. Navigating through the unknowns
Meeting interviewers for the final interview will certainly take more time, even in the remote setup. You will speak with more than one person. Will you have enough time for that? Otherwise you will get stressed about going back to your job. At least you won’t be bombarded by chat notifications or phone calls from your office and they won’t be bothered that you disappeared for longer than usual.

In case you need to visit the office in person, you have to plan in advance the best route. Using Google Street View can help you find the right building. It gets trickier if you have interviews in different city, since you need to prepare for travel by train or plane.

Some companies will coordinate the whole journey so you just need to follow instructions. In case you consider relocating to that place you could take an additional day or two from your vacation or schedule the interview close to the weekend. Would you consider living and working in Helsinki if you’ve never spent time there outside of office?

A trip to another country may impose additional challenges in terms of time zone and foreign language. Also the list of items to take gets longer (tickets, passport, cosmetics, phone charger). Planning ahead will give you peace of mind, which is so important for the conversation. When possible, try to have an interview after a good sleep at the hotel rather than rushing from the airport to the office. Too many candidates underperform the final interview, because they didn’t sleep enough in order to catch an early airplane. No one will excuse weak performance due to travels. It is - again - about the value you can bring to the company.

### 3.2. Your body and spirit
The interlocutors will want to get to know you better. Not only what you have to say is important, but also how you behave: do you smile often, do you send positive vibes? This might be especially important, if you will work with their customers, or internal stakeholders. Also note what the people who work there wear and try to dress as if you belong there. Being overdressed for a talk with a startup might be pretentious, instead of building trust.

Meetings face to face with several company employees can be physically exhausting, whether it’s online or offline. You must be full of mental and physical power, so get a good sleep the night before. Beside your knowledge your level of commitment and personal energy will also be evaluated. Can you last to the fifth talk in row with the same enthusiasm?

## 4. Hard facts
The structure of the job interview is similar in almost every company, although length and order can differ. The main points of talks are:

+ introduction of the candidate and interlocutors,
+ information about the position and the company,
+ questions about the candidate,
+ candidate’s questions about the job.

Additionally you might be asked to take some tests or to prepare a case study to demonstrate your practical skills. And sometimes you might need to do work on it during the interview, not in your free time. A trial day might be too complicated for both sides, so this sample helps to compare your results with those of other candidates.

Below I described four deal-breakers, which you should be aware of.

### 4.1. Achievements
The company has certain expectations towards the future employee. Unfortunately, the job advertisement is too often written quickly, without a thorough understanding of the hiring manager's needs. It is even worse if it is a verbatim copy of an ad published a few months earlier, when they hired for a similar role. In the meantime the situation in the company probably has changed. Also, some companies trying to be open and inclusive pay special attention to wording, thus blurring the difference between must-haves and nice-haves. Still it might happen that one criteria is crucial, be it fluency in German, enthusiasm for cold-calling or coding in Scala. It’s in your best interest to figure it out as soon as possible.

Therefore, I would recommend not getting hooked on the requirements list, but rather to focus on the actual tasks you will be responsible for. Conversation with recruiter and hiring manager can give you a clearer picture than some buzzwords in a job ad. State your answers aligned with what your future employer is expecting you to do.

If your experience doesn’t match the role expectations – due to different industries, tooling or any other reason - suggest that you have the potential to meet those expectations in the right environment. You can always ask, where else your skills might be suitable. Remember that not all jobs are published and recruiters might know about employees who are planning to leave the company.

### 4.2. Motivation
Motivation is often the most overlooked part of self-presentation. Especially if you don’t really look for a job despite interviewing. Don’t say: “I am not looking for a job, you contacted me first”. If you really don’t consider a change, then why did you take the call? 

Searching only for a higher salary in the eyes of the employer might imply that as soon as you get a better offer you will leave his company, too. No wonder that passion, interest in improving one's skills or the desire to lead and mentor a team are solid advantages. People are leaving the companies mainly because of demotivating bosses.

Hence, state your motivation clearly. On the one hand, why do you consider starting something new, on the other hand, why are you not satisfied with your current job. These can be: challenges in your private life (relocation of your spouse, studies), bad financial condition of the company or restructuring. More career related justifications are: lack of opportunities to grow or lead a team, desire to change specialization or scope of duties. Everyone has some frustrations, and your future employer doesn’t want the history to repeat itself.
To avoid it, recruiters may ask why you changed companies in the past. So if the reasons were always the same, it may suggest that you do not know what you are looking for. Are you sure you won’t end up in the same situation in another company?

Your future employer might fear that they won't provide you the right conditions to remain loyal and you will leave too early. For your own good, try to recognize what kind of challenges – not problems – you want to deal with in your next company. There are no perfect companies, only different problems you might choose to deal with.

### 4.3. Salary
Common reason for rejecting candidates is the mismatch between desired salary and what employers could offer. Probably you won’t consider a job with lower pay, unless you relocate to a different place or the company will offer you extraordinary conditions: be it better job title, interesting product to work on, even a better brand to be associated with. Try to estimate how much you would like to earn before the call. Your knowledge of earnings in a given city in a similar position (costs of living and taxation, if you consider relocating) will literally pay off. Otherwise you risk not continuing the talks or losing time.

Not answering the question about your salary wish creates uncertainty. What if the company can’t afford you? Or even worse, if you decide blindly that you’ll accept anything and then will get less than currently. It is assumed that 20% is the reasonable increase when changing jobs. Knowing that a certain company has recently attracted investors, you can demand from them more than from an employer who has recently been going through problems and looking for savings. Your humane attitude can make them more appealing to you.

You won't always know how much the company is willing to pay you, until they understand your expertise after detailed interviews. Then you can reject their offer, or negotiate. Consider that once being hired it may take several months before you will get your first raise. (if you’re hired in Germany). Can you take a lower pay in exchange for stock options?

### 4.4. Starting date
A talent whose company has just gone bankrupt, a freelancer or an unemployed person can often start a new adventure the next day. A full time employee can have a notice period of three or even six months. This is why recruiters will be positively inclined towards people with shorter notice periods. Check your current contract in advance, so there won’t be surprises later when it comes to the starting date. If you are obliged to inform your boss about leaving by the end of the month and you’ll do it one day later, it will delay the start of your new job by an additional month.

This means you should also schedule your interviews accordingly and demand fast feedback. The recruitment process rarely takes less than two weeks. The employer must find time to talk to all the candidates, some interviewers might get sick or be on holidays, some crucial stakeholders might want to have a final interview.

You won’t get a contract at the same time from all potential employers you talk to. Some of them might set a deadline for making your decision. Would you still consider starting talks with Tesla, if you already received an offer from another company?

It’s tempting to play the trump card and continue the talks with others, even after signing the contract. Because of the lengthy notice period, you will spend 3 months in your current company. Probably you won’t be engaged much, so you can use this time to prepare for the new job, while also continuing some promising interviews. When after 3 months you will start a new job, you will still have 6 months of probation. Within those months your employer will understand if they like to work with you, and vice-versa. You can resign from your just started job to accept a better one.

Anyway, don’t burn the bridges. Recruiters also change jobs from time to time. Despite the Data Protection Act you never know who will remember your unprofessional behavior. On the other hand, they might remember how well prepared you were and even recommend you to their new company or some of colleagues from their network. Both options have trade-offs.

## Closing thoughts
Once you took care of the organisational routines dedicate your energy to the content of your talks. Focus on the person you're talking to instead of stressing yourself around questions like "what I'll say to my boss when I'm late", "where I'll find a WiFi spot to talk over Skype" or "how much should I get"?

By knowing what you want (and what to avoid) you have greater chances than candidates who apply anywhere and for any job. But is it worth seeking a new opportunity with another employer, when the situation on the market is not stable? Yes. Better to have options than be forced to act.

Over time, you will notice that a new job interview instead of causing stress will direct your attention towards "what I really want". Then all you have to worry about is how often to look for a new job (if at all), not how to prepare.
